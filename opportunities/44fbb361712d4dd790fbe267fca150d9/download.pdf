Executive Order 14026 ($17.20 per hour) or 13658 ($12.90 per hour). Please see the 
Note at the top of the wage determination for more information. Please also note 
that the minimum wage requirements of Executive Order 14026 and 13658 are not 
currently being enforced as to contracts or contract-like instruments entered into 
with the federal government in connection with seasonal recreational services or 
seasonal recreational equipment rental for the general public on federal lands. The 
minimum wage requirements of Executive Order 14026 also are not currently being 
enforced as to any contract or subcontract to which the states of Texas, Louisiana, 
or Mississippi, including their agencies, are a party.
____________________________________________________________________________________
Note: Executive Order (EO) 13706, Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal 
Contractors, applies to all contracts subject to the Service Contract Act for which 
the contract is awarded (and any solicitation was issued) on or after January 1, 
2017.  If this contract is covered by the EO, the contractor must provide employees 
with 1 hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours they work, up to 56 hours of paid 
sick leave each year. Employees must be permitted to use paid sick leave for their 
own illness, injury or other health-related needs, including preventive care; to 
assist a family member (or person who is like family to the employee) who is ill, 
injured, or has other health-related needs, including preventive care; or for 
reasons resulting from, or to assist a family member (or person who is like family 
to the employee) who is the victim of, domestic violence, sexual assault, or 
stalking.  Additional information on contractor requirements and worker protections 
under the EO is available at www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts.

ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS: 

HEALTH & WELFARE: $5.36 per hour, up to 40 hours per week, or $214.40 per week or 
$929.07 per month
 
HEALTH & WELFARE EO 13706: $4.93 per hour, up to 40 hours per week, or $197.20 per 
week, or $854.53 per month*
 
*This rate is to be used only when compensating employees for performance on an SCA-
covered contract also covered by EO 13706, Establishing Paid Sick Leave for Federal 
Contractors.  A contractor may not receive credit toward its SCA obligations for any 
paid sick leave provided pursuant to EO 13706.

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or 
successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, 4 weeks after 15 years, and 5 weeks after 25 years.
  Length of service includes the whole span of continuous service with the present 
contractor or successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in 
the performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of eleven paid holidays per year:  New Year's Day, Martin 
Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth 
National Independence Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' 
Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A contractor may substitute for any of 
the named holidays another day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated 
to the employees involved.)  (See 29 CFR 4.174)



THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:

1)  COMPUTER EMPLOYEES:  This wage determination does not apply to any individual 
employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as 
defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  (See 41 C.F.R. 6701(3)).  Because most Computer 
Systems Analysts and Computer Programmers who are paid at least $27.63 per hour (or 
at least $684 per week if paid on a salary or fee basis) likely qualify as exempt 
computer professionals under 29 U.S.C. 213(a)(1) and 29 U.S.C. 213(a)(17), this wage 
determination may not include wage rates for all occupations within those job 
families.  In such instances, a conformance will be necessary if there are nonexempt 
employees in these job families working on the contract.

Job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer industry, and are not 
determinative of whether an employee is an exempt computer professional.  To be 
exempt, computer employees who satisfy the compensation requirements must also have 
a primary duty that consists of:

    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including 
consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional 
specifications;

    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or 
modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and 
related to user or system design specifications;

    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer 
programs related to machine operating systems; or

    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which 
requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

Any computer employee who meets the applicable compensation requirements and the 
above duties test qualifies as an exempt computer professional under both section 
13(a)(1) and section 13(a)(17) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. (Field Assistance 
Bulletin No. 2006-3 (Dec. 14, 2006)).  Accordingly, this wage determination will not 
apply to any exempt computer employee regardless of which of these two exemptions is 
utilized.

2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you 
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential 
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am. 
 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your 
regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday 
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime 
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered 
overtime work).


** HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL **

An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that 
represents a high degree of hazard when working with or in close proximity to 
ordnance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This includes work such as 
screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive ordnance, explosives, 
and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder and photoflash powder. 
 All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.  Demilitarization, 
modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations on sensitive 
ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All operations involving re-grading 
and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that 
represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to 
ordnance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials 
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the 
employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the like; 
minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.  All 
operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordnance, explosive, and 
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials 
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for 
ordnance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract 
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or 
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by 
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an 
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage 
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the 
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an 
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual 
cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made 
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to 
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining 
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary 
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning 
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in 
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of ""wash and wear"" 
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do 
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial 
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms 
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work, 
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

** SERVICE CONTRACT ACT DIRECTORY OF OCCUPATIONS **

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the 
""Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations"", Fifth Edition (Revision 1), 
dated September 2015, unless otherwise indicated.
 
** REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE, Standard 
Form 1444 (SF-1444) **

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is 
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to 
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage 
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable 
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted 
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 
4.6(b)(2)(i)).  Such conforming procedures shall be initiated by the contractor 
prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es) of employees 
(See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).  The Wage and Hour Division shall make a final 
determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which 
shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day 
of work on which contract work is performed by them in the classification.  Failure 
to pay such unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested 
parties and/or fully determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the 
date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act 
and this contract.  (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(v)). When multiple wage determinations are 
included in a contract, a separate SF-1444 should be prepared for each wage 
determination to which a class(es) is to be conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed 
occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order 
the proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each 
proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage 
rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the 
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized 
representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the 
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees 
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report 
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent 
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the U.S. 
Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, for review (See 29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(ii)).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or 
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or 
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process 
the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour Division's decision to the 
contractor.

6) Each affected employee shall be furnished by the contractor with a written copy 
of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination (See 
29 CFR 4.6(b)(2)(iii)).

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF-1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the ""Service Contract Act Directory of 
Occupations"" should be used to compare job definitions to ensure that duties 
requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the wage 
determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that 
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination. 
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide 
classifications listed in the wage determination (See 29 CFR 4.152(c)(1))."
