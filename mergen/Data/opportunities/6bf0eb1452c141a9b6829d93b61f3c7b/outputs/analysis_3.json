This number is subject to change based\non needs of the Government due to class changes, including but not limited to cancellations;\nadditions; etc. The number is total rooms and will be broken down by class. At this time the\nGovernment does not know the specific arrival dates or departure dates because classes are still\nregistering. Specific classes with number of students, arrival dates, and departure dates has not\nbeen finalized. Classes will arrive at different dates throughout the months of October 28, 2025,\nthrough March 31, 2026. Rooms will be ordered for the number of students in one (1) class.\nAwards will be made per class. Schedules are received per month. Thus, multiple awards are\nexpected.\nTypically, classes range from 24 students to 48 students; however, may be smaller or larger than\n24 or 48. The classes will be arriving and departing at different times. For example: there may\nbe two (2) classes of 24 students arriving on 4/1/2024 and departing on 4/14/2024; four classes\nof 24 to 48 students arriving on 4/1/2024 and departing on 4/10/2024; and then six classes of 24\nto 48 students arriving on 4/15/2024 and departing on 4/28/2024 and the same for each month\nfollowing.\nThe Government understands that availability will change due to changes and public use. Due to\nthis, the Government will check with the offeror to see if the number of rooms quoted for a\ncertain time period are still available before any resultant award(s). Hotels/motels will have\nfour (4) hours to respond to this email request for availability. The four (4) hours starts\nfrom the time the Government sends the email and is in Eastern Time. If a response is not\nreceived within four (4) hours; then the next hotel will be considered. The only exception is\nif the four (4) hour response would be after 5:00 pm ET. Then the response will be due the\nfollowing weekday by 8:00 am ET unless otherwise noted on the request. NOTE: if\nresponses are needed before the four (4) hours due to an emergency; then the request will\nlist a time frame and if required imminently; then the point of contact listed on the HOTEL\nSERVICES AND PRICES form will be contacted via phone for\navailability. Note: changes to classes happen throughout the month (i.e. class cancellation;\nearly arrivals, late departures; class reduction in size; class increase in size, etc). The\nGovernment will not accept any responses after the four (4) hours.\nPlease submit a completed HOTEL SERVICES AND PRICES form along with additional\ndocumentation required under 52.212-1, 52.212-2, and 52.212-3 below to\nErin.Johnson@fletc.dhs.gov no later than 1:00 pm, ET, October 7, 2025.\nA separate HOTEL SERVICES AND PRICES form can be submitted for each month. A\ndifferent format from the Hotel Services and Prices form CANNOT be used to provide a\nquote. If you are quoting for different hotels; then a separate Hotel Services and Prices\nform is to be submitted for each hotel.

If information required in\nthe Hotel Service and Price form and the required documentation under 52.212-1, 52.212-2,\nand 52.212-3 is not submitted with your quote; then your quote will not be considered for\nan award.\nNote: If you are quoting for a hotel that requires a toll or parking pass to get to the hotel location\n(i.e. Jekyll Island); then the hotel is responsible for reimbursing the students on the day of arrival\nand then supplying passes that will cover the remaining dates of the students stay. This fee must\nbe included in your quoted per night rate.\nNote: If you are quoting for a hotel that has additional fees other than hotel room (i.e. parking\netc); then this fee must be included in your quoted per night rate.\nNote: If you are a third party submitting an offer on behalf of a Hotel Owner, General\nManager, or Director of Sales; offeror must include an authorization letter. This\nauthorization letter must be the same format as Attachment 1 for the hotel quoted; dated\nand signed by the Owner, General Manager, or the Director of Sales of the hotel; not the\nCorporation.

This authorization letter must\nalso include a point of contact (POC) at the hotel who is authorized to make changes in the\nevent of emergencies and the third party cannot be reached; along with a statement that\nthe POC is aware and knowledgeable of the terms and conditions of this RFQ; and the\nPOC understands that only a Contracting Officer can make changes to any order.\nIf more than one (1) authorization letter and quote is received on a hotel from different\nthird party companies and the letters are signed by the person(s) listed above; then the\nGovernment will take the lowest price quote. No matter what agreement is between the\nhotel and the third party or what is listed in the authorization letter. In the case of third\nparties, the hotel is a subcontractor. If a subcontractor does not follow an agreement that\nis in place between the subcontractor and the prime contractor; then that is between the\nPrime contractor and the subcontractor.

This number is subject to change based\non needs of the Government due to class changes, including but not limited to cancellations;\nadditions; etc. The number is total rooms and will be broken down by class. At this time the\nGovernment does not know the specific arrival dates or departure dates because classes are still\nregistering. Specific classes with number of students, arrival dates, and departure dates has not\nbeen finalized. Classes will arrive at different dates throughout the months of October 28, 2025,\nthrough March 31, 2026. Rooms will be ordered for the number of students in one (1) class.\nThus, multiple awards are expected.\nTypically, classes range from 24 students to 48 students; however, may be smaller or larger than\n24 or 48. The classes will be arriving and departing at different times. For example: there may\nbe two (2) classes of 24 students arriving on 4/1/2024 and departing on 4/14/2024; four classes\nof 24 to 48 students arriving on 4/1/2024 and departing on 4/10/2024; and then six classes of 24\nto 48 students arriving on 4/15/2024 and departing on 4/28/2024 and the same for each month\nfollowing.\nThe Government understands that availability will change due to changes and public use. Due to\nthis, the Government will check with the offeror to see if the number of rooms quoted for a\ncertain time period are still available before any resultant award(s). Hotels/motels will have\nfour (4) hours to respond to this email request for availability. The four (4) hours starts\nfrom the time the Government sends the email and is in Eastern Time. If a response is not\nreceived within four (4) hours; then the next hotel will be considered. The only exception is\nif the four (4) hour response would be after 5:00 pm ET. Then the response will be due the\nfollowing weekday by 8:00 am ET unless otherwise noted on the request. NOTE: if\nresponses are needed before the four (4) hours due to an emergency; then the request will\nlist a time frame and if required imminently; then the point of contact listed on the HOTEL\nSERVICES AND PRICES form will be contacted via phone for\navailability. Note: changes to classes happen throughout the month (i.e. class cancellation;\nearly arrivals, late departures; class reduction in size; class increase in size, etc). The\nGovernment will not accept any responses after the four (4) hours.\nPlease submit a completed HOTEL SERVICES AND PRICES form along with additional\ndocumentation required under 52.212-1, 52.212-2, and 52.212-3 below to\nErin.Johnson@fletc.dhs.gov no later than 1:00 pm, ET, October 3, 2025.\nA separate HOTEL SERVICES AND PRICES form can be submitted for each month. A\ndifferent format from the Hotel Services and Prices form CANNOT be used to provide a\nquote. If you are quoting for different hotels; then a separate Hotel Services and Prices\nform is to be submitted for each hotel. It is acceptable to submit hotel availability dates on\na separate document; however, the Hotel Service and Prices form must be attached with all\ninformation filled in, but under the line items \u201csee attached,\u201d and the dates are to be clearly\nlisted for each of the line items (0001, 0002, 003). See 52.212-1.

This fee must\nbe included in your quoted per night rate.\nNote: If you are quoting for a hotel that has additional fees other than hotel room (i.e. parking\netc); then this fee must be included in your quoted per night rate.\nNote: If you are a third party submitting an offer on behalf of a Hotel Owner, General\nManager, or Director of Sales; offeror must include an authorization letter. This\nauthorization letter must be the same format as Attachment 4; for the hotel quoted; dated\nand signed by the Owner, General Manager, or the Director of Sales of the hotel; not the\nCorporation.
